# Unidev Corporation
My friends and I made a game for a class wherein you play as the Unidev Corporation's newly-hired Population Control Manager (PCM). With the ongoing crisis on resources, they are tasked with controlling the population in alternate Earth. As the PCM, go into the lives of different people and species and influence the population from their point of view.

We wanted to make a game that encouraged or built a positive view towards voluntarist methods of population control through the repeated process of situations wherein your choices affect the outcome.

We created this game with inspiration from Trolley Problem games, Death and Taxes, the movie What Happened To Monday (2017), and Brown's study on controlling overpopulation.
